		Description: Number Learner tries to predict the next numerical input from a sequence. It tries to do this by treating each input as a state  <br />
		
		<h2>How to use Number Learner</h2>
		
		
		<h2>Things to try</h2>
		
		<p>As Number Learner displays the differences between elements, it can be seen as displaying a kind of derivative. You can see this for yourself by inputting a function that you know the derivative of, and seeing how Number Learner shows that derivative. For example, try "return Math.pow(n,2);"&mdash;n to the power of two. If you're capable of Calculus, you'll know that the first derivative is 2n, the second derivative is 2, and the third derivative and beyond are 0. So go ahead and see how Number Learner shows this.</p>
