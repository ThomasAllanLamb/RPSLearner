#TODO

- Several functions e.g. arrayMap.get, arrayMap.set solve something by using helper methods. But instead of having separate methods, they overload the original method. This seems messy. Convert to two separate methods: one public, one private helper.
- Prune unused dependencies
- Webpack style
- Webpack title
- When updating statistics, don't use .innerHTML. Use method intended for text.
